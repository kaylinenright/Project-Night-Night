        <p itemprop="about">Our mission is to provide free Night Night Packages to homeless children from birth to pre-teen who need our childhood essentials to have a concrete and predictable source of security and increased exposure to high-quality literacy materials during this time of upheaval. Each Night Night Package contains a new security blanket, an age-appropriate children’s book, and a stuffed animal — all nestled inside of a new canvas tote bag. Project Night Night works with tens of thousands of individuals each year who volunteer their time and talents to make our world a better place.</p>
        <p>Voted the <strong><em>Best Children’s Charity by San Francisco Magazine</strong></em>, Project Night Night has emerged as a leading provider of nighttime comforts for homeless children.</p>

    	<div class="gutter unit unit-sx-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1-2 ">
    	   <h3 class="h3-blue">Emotional Needs</h3>
            <p itemprop="about">There are approximately 298,000 homeless families in the United States.* Currently, there are more homeless children in the U.S. than at any other time since the Great Depression. Nonetheless, family homelessness often goes unseen as most homeless families do not live on the street.** Instead, most homeless families are transient, living in shelters, in cars, in hotels in the city’s poorest neighborhoods, or staying with friends or family members.*** These environmental stresses negatively influence a child’s early experiences and often lead to an increase in mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, poor sleep habits, and behavioral issues. To ease the anxiety associated with shelter living, Project Night Night distributes Night Night Packages to homeless children ages 0-10. Each Night Night Package includes an age-appropriate book, a baby blanket which can be cuddled, and a stuffed animal which can become a cherished friend. Finding comfort is vitally important for children in order to feel secure, loved, and valued – even in the midst of the upheaval and uncertainty attendant to homelessness.</p>

        <div class="gutter unit unit-sx-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1-2 ">
            <h3 class="h3-blue">Educational Needs</h3>
            <p itemprop="about">Project Night Night distributes over 25,000 books each year to homeless children. Children who are homeless often have lower academic achievement, exacerbated by frequent moves, lack of privacy and psychological distress, than do children with homes. Many homeless children report that they had difficulty finding a quiet place to study or do homework while in the shelter.</p>
            <h3 class="h3-blue">The Environment</h3>
            <p>Project Night Night utilizes donated “like-new” books and stuffed animals for our Night Night Packages. We have collection boxes and mail delivery locations for donors to send items that might otherwise be discarded. Since 2005, Project Night Night has reused over 50,000 books and stuffed animals.</p>
