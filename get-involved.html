			<h3>Kids Fundraising &amp; Philanthrophy Zone</h3>
			<p>As a kid, you're always looking for new ways to be awesome.  At Project Night Night,	we want to give you the tools to do just that -- and in the process, you will help other kids who could use someone awesome by their side.</p>
			<p>With our Be Awesome Program, we'll help you raise money and make a real difference by doing lots of things you already do:  using your computer to create cool invitations, talking to your friends and family about things that interest you, and throwing fun parties.  The Be Awesome Program is about using all that's good in you to help out someone else.</p>
			<p>Every $20 you raise lets us put a Night Night Package into the arms of homeless child. With that money, we will send a tote bag filled with an awesome blanket, book, and stuffed animal to a child living in a shelter. </p>
